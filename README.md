# discord-fivem-ic-licenses
 A Node.js Program.

# About
Another non user-friendly discord bot.
With this, you can manage users in-game licenses (weapon license, drive license)  by using a discord command.
I will update this to be more user friendly, since right now it only works for a specific version of the ESX Framework.

# Commands
```/dajlicence <steamhex> <type>```
